# Orchestrator 2D Tutorial

This is an example of Godot [Your first 2d game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html#contents)
It should be as close to a 1:1 from gd script to Orchestrator

If you want to do that tutorial and you get stuck you can use this project as a reference how to do something.

## Requirements

* Godot 4.3+
* Orchestrator 2.1+
